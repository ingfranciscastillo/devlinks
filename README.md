  # DevLinks

  *Developer identity, in one address.*

A developer profile for your work, writing, projects, and everything you want people to find — one link, always up to date.

## Features

- **GitHub-native** — repositories, activity, and contributions kept in sync automatically.
- **Auto-imports** — writing and activity pulled in from Dev.to, Medium, Stack Overflow, and more.
- **Theme builder** — full control over colors, typography, layout, and effects, down to custom CSS.
- **Snippets, projects & articles** — publish syntax-highlighted code and showcase your work directly on your page.
- **Discover** — a searchable directory of developer profiles, filterable by stack, seniority, and availability.
- **Analytics** — first-party, cookieless page view and click tracking.
- **Built for speed** — server-rendered, accessible, and SEO-first from the start.
